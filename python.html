                   <mark><strong>Python</strong></mark> was created in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum, the Python community's 
                   Benevolent Dictator for Life. It started out as a hobby project to work in during Christmas vacation, and was born out of
                   the ABC language. The ABC language was a terminated project of the Dutch CWI research institute, whic is where
                   van Rossum worked.

                   of how to do it. Python is also a excellent programming language for beginners due to its simple
                   syntax when being compared to other languages. It hs many great feaures, such as:
