                   <mark><strong>Java</strong></mark> is another object-oriented programming language. It was developed in the early 1990s by a small team of 
                   engineers working at Sun Microsystems at the time. THe team consisted of James Gosling (the main developer), Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton.
                   The team was known to others as the 'Green Team'. It was initially called the Oak Programming
                   Language.

                <p>
                   The language borrows much syntax from both C and C++, but has a simpler object model. Java is also a High 
                   Level Programming Lanuage. It was developed according to the principle of WORA 
                   (Write Once Run Anywhere). It was introduced to the public in 1995 and is now owned by 
                   Oracle. The 'Green Team' had five goals in mind when designing the language:
